  <h1>Engineered Autonomy</h1>
  <p>The era of the college cog is fading as access to resources and knowledge continues to expand. While
    learning to live autonomously does not come without a debt of responsibility, the key is in shifting that burden to
    where its tenable.</p>
  <img src="graphic.gif" width="100%"><br><br>
  <h2>Addressing the Baggage</h2>
  <p>Autonomy is a loaded term that distracts from what I&#39;m trying to express, but its the best I found. What
    I&#39;m trying to speak to is enabling the unique attributes and experiences of an individual to inform the actions
    they take in life. Leveraging their eccentricities and giving their spent time personal relevance.</p>
  <p>*feel free to contact me with a better term that embodies what I&#39;m trying to express. As robust terminology
    cannot be discounted in it&#39;s ability to enable more people to communicate and work with a topic.</p>
  <h3>The Power of Pseudo Code</h3>
  <p>(In order to provide context and a foothold to adapt to what is to come in this article, the following section
    explains my decision making.)</p>
  <p> Mathematical notation enables a professional to work with equations in a terse yet deep way. Computer code is a way
    to communicate computation to hardware in a language and context specific format. Both are near inaccessible to anyone
    external, locking away countless powerful understandings. When there are attempts to build a bridge to others, it is
    through lengthy prose and a heavy reliance on deep ancillary knowledge. Resulting in few attempts to reach out and
    communicate, with even fewer to listen and understand.</p>
  <p>When you remove code from it&#39;s language and context specific formalities, it becomes pseudo code, a powerful and
    accessible vessel of information. Coupled with the recent advances of AI language models you can both convert to and
    from this format effortlessly. As I come from a coding background I will be using this communication tool liberally.
  </p>
  <h2>Solving the &quot;What to Learn&quot; Problem</h2>
  <p>Many try and answer this as if it were a static question with a knowable answer. I&#39;d argue that it is purely a
    directional problem that is always shifting, as you and the world are both in a constant state of change. So instead
    we need a model that reflects this reality and leads us to the best outcomes.</p>
  <pre>direction = (to - from).normalized</pre>
  <p>To derive a <strong>direction</strong> we need to know where we are coming <strong>from</strong>, and where we&#39;d
    like <strong>to</strong> go. We then <strong>normalize</strong>(set length to 1) the difference between the two to get
    a consistent variable to work with.</p>
  <p>Once a direction is clear, the obstacles you encounter become what is necessary to overcome and learn.</p>
  <h3>The &quot;Learning to Learn&quot; Lie</h3>
  <p>Now that you know what you need to learn. You can see how our education systems are failing us. They both assume what
    you need to know and manufacture contrived obstacles to judge you upon.</p>
  <p>While the long term success rate of their system is higher than zero and is largely the result of trying to funnel as
    many students through their structure as possible. We can do better, starting with the people who are hurt more then
    they are helped by this system.</p>
  <h2>Building Momentum</h2>
  <pre>momentum = resources * effort</pre>
  <p>A direction won&#39;t affect much until it is acted upon, by employing <strong>resources</strong> and
    <strong>effort</strong> momentum can be generated. Your capacity in these areas is something you need to be aware of
    when taking action or setting expectations. There is plenty of good advice out there i.e. the tortoise beats the hare
    in a race, bikers gear down when encountering tough terrain, the little engine that could... The one I&#39;d like to
    highlight the most is in valuing the deliberate actions you take over the results you achieve, because the former is
    actually within your control and shines through in long run.
  </p>
  <pre>velocity = momentum / mass</pre>
  <p>Just like fat there are both necessary kinds of <strong>mass</strong> as well as forms to avoid. For example you need
    at least some features and man power to get a company/product on the market. Though you can easily slip into feature
    creep, untenable collateral, sunk cost fallacy just to name a few. A good rule of thumb is that you want your momentum
    &gt; mass. If that is not the case, you&#39;ll need to take a critical eye to what you are doing and see what you can
    shave off.</p>
  <pre>velocity /= 1 + drag</pre>
  <p><strong>Drag</strong> goes by many names though it can be identified as anything that tries to cling on for its own
    sake while your trying to make progress.</p>
  <pre>position += direction * velocity</pre>
  <p>With all of this put together your <strong>position</strong> will then be moving in the direction of your choosing
    *autonomy. Keep in mind that progress is usually slow but soon enough you will have quite a bit to look back on, not
    to mention a different perspective from your new found position in life.</p>
  <h3>Overcoming Obstacles</h3>
  <p>There is no one size fits all solution to deploy when stumbling upon a complication. Instead what matters the most,
    is how much time and effort the problem is worth. Because, at the end of the day you can always regroup and attack the
    problem anew. </p>
  <p>As you gain new insight by wrestling with the issue, its important to consistently re-evaluate your strategy as well
    as your pre-conceived short term goals. In order to not get lost and frustrated in the swamp of complexity.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>I probably tried to pack too much into this one article, so let me know how I should break this apart into more
    digestible pieces. Or <a href="/tutoring">sign up</a> for my tech tutoring sessions, where I can answer questions one on one and walk you
    through the application of these models.</p>
