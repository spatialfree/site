diversity breeds division?

is division even the word I'm looking for?

        people love to try their luck and watch other's try theirs
    stick
        the winner from the one's who participate is fueled by all who participated
        so the incumbent takes an L by not participating
        it's all just fun and games until it's too late ^-^

        don't participate and ensure loss of easy funding
        participate and inadvertantly validate and boost the viability of the system


the candidates must all agree to play by these rules
... actually no, 


so a slow adaptable takeover

! if this truly does result in better candidates




now it's all messaging

player v 

fates decide


this is the third party... nope that pits the other two against you lol

it's surprisingly apolitical and headless so it's not really a party
any cadidate can participate, no matter their party affiliation

the resources of all participating are put into a smart contract
and then funneled into the winner

display openly how much each running candidate has put into the pot (thus far?)



this is the fucking solution, holy shit

this is truly a viral design, now it's time to build it and infect the masses


one issue...

how the fuck! do we ensure legitimate votes???
1st filter: you pay tax = you can vote
    verify how?

2nd filter: locality

3rd filter: individual
