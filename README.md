  connect weekly.js to loop(->circuit) 
  ^^^^^^^just this for today^^^^^^^^
  feat. page *easy to link to



notes:

vscode live share
vscode.dev/"repo url"
https://meet.jit.si/

design lived insights:
  policy precedes automation
  plus we establish better raport through direct communication rather than automated notifications and webhooks
  don't automate away friction, wear, tear, misuse... instead maximizing lasting traction (x = time, y = traction)

wait! lol
all I need is an easier view of the calendar
they can just let me know of any changes
anywys it feels weird to have user accounts on a personal site

outline the steps:
  get email, review, remember, open dev env, transcribe to js, QC, bust cache, deploy
  the remember gap is the roughest part y?
  because I can't just do it on my phone
  why? because it's annoying to get to and edit
  and cache busting is a hair pulling process

policy:
verify within 24hrs  !!remind myself in the form email lol
add them as a contact!!remind myself in the form email lol
reminder the day before  !! remind myself with loop *circuit

because they are not going back to check the page, cache busting is a low priority, as new visitors looking to sign up will have the fresh stuff
so no issue there!
thank god!
this is the solution we need!
