  <h2>background</h2>
  <p>ive experienced a wide variety of schools. from public to private with the occasional lucky home school year, half built early online systems, even international. not to mention plenty of exotic extracurriculars. i remember starting out as a ruthless self driven learner, always maxing out my local libraries borrow limit. but the common flaws of these education systems eventually wore on me. graduating with the last bit of my momentum, i drifted for a couple years until i came to a stop.</p>
  <p>reflecting on my core strengths and passions with the little i had access to i re-approached software development. kicking things off with gamedev, i found some online courses. the progress was slow impersonal and half arbitrary. one day i happened upon game jams. with their unique time and theme constraints, backed with community support. i had the environment i needed to begin to rebuild my self driven nature.</p>
  <p>4 years later through iteration and hardship, ive built several companies and more importantly the core mental structures needed to make my own way through our technological world. with this perspective i'd be remiss to not pass on these systems that continue to be so life changing for me.</p>
